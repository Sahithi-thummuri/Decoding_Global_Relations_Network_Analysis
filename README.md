# Decoding Global Relations: A Time-Based Network Analysis of International Relations

The project aims to identify key players that influence the connections between nations in the context of International Relations by employing network analysis techniques like degree centrality, community detection, and leveraging the growing volume of data on international relations. We used the alliance and sanctions data to determine the changes in relationships from 1975 to 2010.

Tools:
1. Gephi
2. Networkx- Python library

1. Nodes size: Degree Centrality 
2. Node color: Modularity 
3. Edges size: Weights (Duration of years)
